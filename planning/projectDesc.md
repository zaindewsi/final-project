# Project Description

This app allows beginner and intermediate cryptocurrency users to create or restore a cryptocurrency wallet (starting with bitcoin cash) so that they may send and receive transactions including tokens. We would like to allow users to put up offers to "atomic swap" tokens with other users using on-chain smart contracts, assuming their offer gets accepted.
